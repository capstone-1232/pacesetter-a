<h1>Rentals</h1>
<p>Renters are responsible for the equipment rented while it is in your possession for the duration of your rental. Return your equipment before 2pm on your drop-off day, in clean condition, to avoid additional charges. For equipment not returned or damaged, the renter will be charged full replacement value for the missing or damaged piece(s) of equipment. If the equipment that you rent is returned to us late, additional daily rental charges will apply for each day that they are returned late.</p>

            <h3>Demo Purchase Policy</h3>
            <div>
            <p>Customers who decide that they would like to purchase a pair of skis
                that they took for demo are eligible for a credit from the rental of the skis
                that were rented.
                Maximum credit that can be used towards the purchase of a “new pair”
                of skis is two days of rental.
                (example $50 for the 1st day and $30 for the 2nd day – total of $80)
                The rental credit is to be used towards the purchase of a “new pair” of
                the same skis that were rented for demo and cannot be used towards
                any other product.
                Rental credit is only applicable to the purchase of a “new pair” of skis at
                regular price and cannot be used to purchase skis that are on sale.</p>
            </div> <!-- demo div 1 end -->
            <div>
                <p>If we do not have stock available to sell the customer a “new pair” of skis OR we cannot order a pair of skis from the supplier for the customer, we will consider selling the demo skis. If we agree to sell the demo skis, a price will be determined and the customer’s rental cost to demo the skis will not be applicable to the purchase of the set of demo skis. If the customer does not purchase a “new pair” of skis upon the return of the demo skis, they will have up to 30 days from date of rental return for the rental credit to be valid towards the purchase of a “new pair” of skis. The customer needs to retain the customer copy of the rental form and show store staff the form at the time of purchase to activate the rental credit for the purchase of a new pair of skis within the period explained above.</p>
